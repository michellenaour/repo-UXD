# High Fidelity Mockups

Taking from the last step's wireframe, we build a high fidelity mockup that show a real sense of what the application would be. This mockup has all the 
color, shapes, icons, buttons and interactions that a working prototype should.

## Accessibility

Our final version [HI FI v4](https://github.com/michellenaour/repo-UXD/blob/3a05367fb5068d8aba6d24f7329150f97122dae1/5.%20The%20surface%20plane/Hi%20fidelity%20mockups/Hi%20Fi%20v4.pdf)
addresses accessibility in three main aspects:

### Interactive elements.
Our solution uses a mobile app, this miplies that screens will be generally small. Interactivve elements need to be of a minimal size and properly spaced to give a good experience to users. We resized buttons and spaced them more so they are more easy to click. We also give labels to icons and buttons that did not have them.

### Color
We have to avoid using oversaturated colors and high contrast in the desing because this is generally annoying. In the other hand, low contrast can make the content hard to see, specially in users with reduced vision. For this, we changed colors so that they are within the 4.5:1 contrast relation. Also, we add fade effects in areas where colors of different elements blend.

### Gender neutrality
We avoid in all the text and messages, assuming the gender of the user.

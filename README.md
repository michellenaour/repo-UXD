## Problem identification

Health has always been and will always be a priority for people, so it is necessary to constantly buy medications and medical supplies for our friends and family. However, how do we know where to buy and at what price? These questions are becoming more and more important with the pandemic, as leaving the house is increasingly dangerous and people want to go directly to the indicated place without losing time looking for it. That is why it is important to know the places closest to our home to be able to compare them and find the best place to buy medications and medical supplies.

## Problem solution proposal

As a team we wanted to help solve some of the problems raised above, and for that, we sought to implement an application that allows us to search and compare the closest pharmacies, filtering them according to the user's needs, thus facilitating the departure of the person, saving time, money and fixing a place to buy from home so as not to go around unnecessary.

In this repository, we go through the 5 planes of user experience design to build a solution in which all the content, funcitonalities and aesthetical decisions are allign with the our target user needs, that leads to a more succesful and satisfying user experience.

## Planes
Each plane of the user experience design builds based on the previous one. And together, they create an integral approach that ensures that the final design meets the user needs.

1. [Strategy plane](/1.%20Strategy%20plane/) : This plane involves identifying the users needs as well as our own goals.
2. [Scope plane](/2.%20Scope%20plane/) : Defines the features and functionalities. 
3. [Structure plane](/3.%20Sctructure%20plane/) : Organize and arranges the elements of user experience, creating an user flow.
4. [Skeleton plane](/4.%20Skeleton%20plane/) : Involves creating a rough design of the content and layout.
5. [Surface plane](/5.%20The%20surface%20plane/) : Desing of the visual and interactive elements including color, fonts, icons and interactions.

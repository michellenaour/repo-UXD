## Description UX Personas

The idea of creating these personas is to make your users as close as possible to reality, for this you have to study them carefully with qualitative and quantitative user research and web analysis.

These folks help improve site component decisions by adding a bit of reality.

Also these people offer an easy and cheap way to test those features throughout the development process of the project and thus avoid possible errors.

We defined 3 personas: Anita, Claudia and Miguel that aiming to represent the variety of realitys in which our application would be used, and also represent our 3 main goals:

- Anita has complications using technology, so our application must be <ins>**easy to use**</ins>, and friendly to all type of users.
- Claudia is younger and is confortable with technology, but her limitation is time. The experience inside our app has to be <ins>**as quick as possible**</ins>, avoiding innecesary steps.
- Miguel is the youngest, he buys a lot of stuff for his cat and needs to save money. While mantaining the previous characteristics, the app needs to easily show what is the <ins>**best price**</ins> or alternative for an item.

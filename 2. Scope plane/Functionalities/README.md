# Functionalities
Once the user needs and business objectives are defined in the strategy plane, we can transform these objectives into functional requirements for our product.

When building a product, it is crucial to have a clear and defined scope of what will be offered to our users in advance, so that all members of the team understand the boundaries and limitations of the design. This will help ensure that the product meets the user needs and business objectives, and that the development process is efficient and effective.

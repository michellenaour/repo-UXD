# Navigation Flow 
 
Is the sequence in which users can interact with the content. Is the map of navigation between one screen and another.Generally the navigation flow is role based.

Our navigation flow starts with a first screen on which we will display the logo for a second. If the user is logged in, the home page will be shown, otherwise, the login page will. We call this set of 3 screens The Login Flow.

from the home page, the user can navigate to:
- Their profile
- Search bar
- shopping Cart

From  user profile, we can go to Edit profile. We call this two screens the User Profile Flow
From the search bar  we can go to search results, and then to product details. We call this set of 3 screens The Search Flow.

From the shopping cart we can go to the checkout page. We call this set of 3 screens The Check-out flow.

* From any page, we can navigate to The home/landing page.
